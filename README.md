# qfx2csv.py

I made this script convert my bank statements from qfx format to csv for
importing into firefly-iii, a banking app I use.

There are other scripts like this floating around on the internet, however they
were written years ago and in python2, so unless you would like to fix those,
this was made with python3 from the beginning.

## Dependencies
The only dependency is the ofxtools python package, which can be installed with pip
